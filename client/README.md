## Tim Huitt

I'm a Software Developer with a passion for solving complex problems through creative programming. I've spent several years building my development skills, initially through self-teaching and now formal education. 

> Along the way, I have acquired extensive leadership experience in various industries, including service, finance, and analytics, where I've excelled at guiding, directing, and training teams and management. 

> In addition to many personal and collaborative projects, I have developed several professional applications using Python for standalone programs and VBA for complex excel data processing and manipulation. 

> My career journey has equipped me with the ability to drive improved efficiencies and processes. I'm now eager to leverage my skills to become a valuable asset to any team.
